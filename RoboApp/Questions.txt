Is it considered better, while parsing a document to always go to the source when retrieving elements
For example a function that returns the first line of the robots instructions would be far more concise if it was passed in the 3 lines from.
If I were to have each function be informed by other functions it feels a lot more breakable, but it feels like there would be a lot of duplicate otherwise.

Just seen the linq select method which I am going to try and use.

The cardinal points were originally objects with a next and previous property. Which for the most part is the same as what is happening now with the array, it might of just improved the readability of the code.

Crashed could be informed by passing in the list of objects after each move, essentially moving that logic from the main to the robot class which would probably be a decent bit neater.

There has got to be a better way to do the logic in main.

Unit testing the fileParser if it remains the same, how should this be done?
